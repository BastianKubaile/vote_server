# Vote Sever for the Voting Ap
This the backend for the [Vote App](https://github.com/BastianKubaile/Vote). 
## How to use
Navigate to the directory you want to use then run
```
git clone https://github.com/BastianKubaile/vote_server
cd vote_server
npm install
npm start
```
And that's it! The Server will be listening on port 4000, processing incoming requests from the frontend. The data will be saved on a locally hosted mongo server by default. Make sure that the DB is running.
